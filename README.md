This project has been done by downloading the raw file "Power BI - Final Project" ( Source: Alex - The Analyst Github ).

The project involves some bit of Data Cleaning and subsequent visualisations from this data set.

The eight different visualisations show the summary of 630 Data Professionals with respect to their favourite Programming Language, Average Salary by Job Title, Happiness & Work Life Balance etc.
